Thank you for working through this scenario! To recap, we have:

- Quantized the saved pneumonia classification model for weights as a post-training optimization.

- Validated that we gain 80% in size just by doing this.

- Learned about quantizing activations with a representative dataset and doing full-integer quantization.

- Evaluated both models to verify performance.

I hope you learned from this, and will move on to the next scenario in the set!
