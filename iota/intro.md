In this scenario, we will build upon the Use Transfer Learning to Classify Pneumonia with TensorFlow scenario, and also use the TensorFlow Lite converter to learn how to convert our TensorFlow models to TensorFlow Lite models.

The objective of this scenario is to show how easily you can convert a model from normal TensorFlow to TensorFlow Lite using the Python Converter API. Note that this step is necessary in order to run your models on edge and cell devices.

I hope you enjoy it!
